SYSTEM DESIGN

Input Design

Input design is a crucial phase in system development. It focuses on how users enter data into the system and ensures that the data provided is accurate, valid, and complete. The main objective of input design in the Intelligent Learning System is to create simple, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for students, instructors, and administrators.

In the Intelligent Learning System, inputs are mainly collected through web-based forms and interactive interfaces. During student registration, the system collects details such as name, email, password, educational qualification, and learning interests. Proper validation is applied to ensure correct email format, strong passwords, and mandatory field completion.

When logging in, users provide their registered email and password, which are authenticated securely. Students also provide inputs while enrolling in courses, attempting quizzes, submitting assignments, and giving feedback. Quiz inputs include selecting answers (radio buttons or checkboxes), while assignment submissions allow file uploads with format and size validation.

The system also collects learning preference inputs such as preferred subjects, skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced), and learning goals. These inputs help the recommendation engine suggest suitable courses and learning materials.

For instructors, input forms are available to create and manage courses. They enter course titles, descriptions, module content, video links, assignments, and quiz questions. Validation ensures that course details are complete and structured properly.

Administrators provide inputs while managing users, approving courses, updating categories, and monitoring system performance. The system prevents duplicate entries, invalid data formats, and unauthorized access through proper validation and authentication mechanisms.


Output Design

Output design focuses on presenting processed information in a clear, organized, and meaningful manner. In the Intelligent Learning System, outputs are designed separately for students, instructors, and administrators to ensure better usability and decision-making.

For students, outputs include personalized course recommendations, course details, learning progress reports, quiz results, certificates, and performance analytics. Students can also view their enrolled courses and progress in a dashboard with graphical indicators such as progress bars and charts.

For instructors, outputs include student enrollment lists, performance reports, assignment submissions, and course analytics. They can view student progress, average quiz scores, and engagement statistics through dashboards. These outputs help instructors improve course content and teaching strategies.

For administrators, outputs include system-wide reports such as total users, active learners, course performance and revenue . Reports can be displayed in tabular format or graphical charts.

The system ensures that all outputs are accurate, well-formatted, and updated in real time. By providing structured dashboards, progress tracking, and performance insights, the Intelligent Learning System enhances user experience and supports effective learning management.
